# notifyscripts
A collection of scripts i use for hotkeys/notify for i3wm

When i switched to [Linux Notification Center](https://github.com/phuhl/linux_notification_center) i decided to write some scripts of my own,
both for educational purposes and to get the features i want.

Filenames should be pretty explanatory for now, guide will eventually come later on.
